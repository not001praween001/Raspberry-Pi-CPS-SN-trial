Raspberry-Pi-CPS-SN-trial
=========================

This is a raspbian image support CPS virtualize environment for implement sensor and actuator network flexible on the web. It is simple environment for education and non-profit objective embedded Linux kernel image. The image is trail and backup with non-profit propose. The environment is automatively running with Blue-sky cloud server. We will not responding anymore with the people who use this image with another ojective written above.

The environment shows that how we can implement the bridge environment about sensor and actuator network to flexible, robustness on the web from small scale to large scale of such environment. Because, the environment is now developing, We're very glad to welcome the people who love to help us to develop it together. Please, contact me directly. Thanks for your help.

Getting Started
===========
This kernel has been modified from standard Raspbian kernel. You can learn about the standard Raspbian at [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). And then using the Bluesky-Raspbian kernel image from [our project repository](https://github.com/Bluesky-CPS). The Bluesky-Raspbian kernel is coorperated with [BlueSky cloud](https://github.com/not001praween001/BlueSkyLoggerCloudBINResearchVer1.0). The environment preparation has only two step  below.

・ Step1: Prepare the server side. See the [BlueSky cloud](https://github.com/not001praween001/BlueSkyLoggerCloudBINResearchVer1.0).

・ Step2: Prepare the Embedded Devices side. See the next topic below respectively.

Then you can enjoy about our virtual environmental CPS.

Download or clone git
-------------------------
```shell
git clone https://github.com/not001praween001/Raspberry-Pi-CPS-SN-trial.git
cd Raspberry-Pi-CPS-SN-trial
```
Image preparation (Burning Raspberry-Pi-CPS kernel)
---------------------------------------------------

The image is splited compressing data file. You can merge all splited file by "cat" on Linux environment. Then, uncompressed image file to your harddrive. The raw image file name is "RaspberryPi-SN-backup_20121030". You can burn it to your RaspberryPis SD card. Image file size is 8GB.
```shell
cat RaspberryPi-SN-backup_20121030.tgz.* > RaspberryPi-SN-backup_20121030.tgz
tar -xvf RaspberryPi-SN-backup_20121030.tgz
sudo dd if=RaspberryPi-SN-20121030 of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```
X is device name. The SD Memory Card capacity should be more than 8GB.

Login
-------------------------

Insert your burned SD card into your Raspberry PIs. Then, plug your pi electric power and HDMI cable.

You can login via both tty serial and SSH.
